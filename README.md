# Starter Bootstrap for Alchemy Code Lab

This is the source code for the Alchemy Code Lab Career Track bootstrap script.

## Usage

`npm init @alchemycodelab/app@latest`

## Making Changes to the Bootstrap

You can fork this repo and make any changes, but in order for the package to be updated on the [NPM Repository](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@alchemycodelab/create-app), you will need to be a part of the `@alchemycodelab` org on NPM and have publishing access.

With access, you can then make your changes, update the `package.json` file to a new version, then run `npm publish`.
